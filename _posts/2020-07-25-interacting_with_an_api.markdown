An application programming interface (API) is an agreed upon set of rules, methods, or protocols programs use to communicate with each other. Usually on one end is the server, or the message receiver, and the other end is the client, the message sender. API have become an essential part of modern web integration and are utilized by many to retrieve client data or interact with saved information in a database.
Why use an API?
Using an API’s defined communication protocol enables developers to quickly build, scale, and integrate applications to launch products. Many challenges faced while developing an application, big and small, have already been solved. By learning to use API’s you can leverage existing logic or code, you do not have to write, to save you time and increase your development effectiveness. The goal of an API is to make your life as a developer easier by exposing agreed upon access to internal programmatic functionality or endpoints that allows programs to interact and communicate.
How does an API work?
All API’s are not the same, however, they are based on rules that allow programs to communicate with each other. Typically, an API is built using rules that developers follow called Representational State Transfer (REST) conventions. One of the REST rules states that you should be able to get data or a resource when you link to a specific URL. Each URL is then called a request and the data received back is called a response. The request exchange is then broken up into several key parts.
Endpoint — the route or URL you requested
Method — the type of request you send the server to perform create, read, update, delete (CRUD) functionality(e.g., GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
Headers — provide information to the server and client, such as authentication and providing information about the body content
Data/Body — contains information you want to be sent to the server and is only used when the client is send not receiving information
There are many other factors to consider when developing or using an API but these are some of the key features to allow for programs to communicate with each other. Most API will also provide documentation or other tools to help facilitate use and accessibility. API’s play a critical role in modern web technology and tremendously increase flexibility and extensibility of of developer programming.
